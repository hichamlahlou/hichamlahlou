I have a mathematical background in operations research and have been working in the supply chain area for the last 20 years.
Supply chain is a pretty wide area, I had the chance to work on:
- Production planning @ Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia)
- Forecasting and spare part management @ Dassault Aviation + Zodiac Aeorspace (now Safran) + Airbus

Since 2016, I am a partner @ frePPLe, a company that implements the best open source APS (advanced planning and scheduling software) on the market.

On my spare time, I like playing tennis and I am trying to learn electric guitar (and this is giving me hard time).
